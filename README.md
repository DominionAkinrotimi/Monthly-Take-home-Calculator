# Monthly Takehome Calculator

This Python algorithm calculates the total monthly takehome for a newspaper vendor. The vendor receives a fixed salary of 20,000 naira and a 10% commission on total monthly sales exceeding 100,000 naira. The user is prompted to input the total monthly sales (TMS), and the algorithm computes the commission (comm) based on the defined conditions. The total monthly takehome (TMT) is then calculated by adding the salary and commission. The algorithm provides a straightforward way to determine the vendor's earnings for a given month.
